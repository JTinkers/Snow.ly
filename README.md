# Snow.ly

Snowly is a simple CMS built using Laravel & Vue.js.

Snowly was (at first) created for my friends who needed a quick website that would allow them to post their thoughts, write articles, tell a little bit about themselves, get in contact with potential employer or show-off projects - this is why Snowly supplies you with a blog, articles, projects (fetched from github), about and contact page right out of the box - all of which (except Contact) can be entirely hidden.

While the whole system isn't very robust, it was more of a learning experience for me, but since my friends really enjoyed the outcome and use it on a daily basis - I've decided to release it to the public.

## General Features

- A decent admin panel created using Bootstrap (it's not pretty, but it works!).
- Premade pages, out of which all but 'contact page' can be hidden entirely.
- Responsive design that'll work on all (99%) devices.
- Modern design, highly intuitional and effective.

## Preview
I haven't setup a proper environment for the preview, but here's a pack of screenshots:

## Known bugs

- HTML Editor's preview doesn't have style applied to it properly - it's caused by Vue.js scoping system and will be fixed soon.
- Theme system isn't added despite it being listed in the admin panel.
